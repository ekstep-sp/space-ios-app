      programming languages (<a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank">TIOBE Index</a>). Running
      under the continuous process of enhancement and evolution, it has always taken into consideration the
      requirements of the past and the future.</p>

    <p style="color:#333333; font-family:Verdana; font-size:16px">The need for better adaptation of future releases and
      the needs of today&#39;s developers calls&nbsp;for improvements in the language, library, performance and
      learning curve. Taking this into consideration, the&nbsp;combined&nbsp;effort and collaboration of the industry,
      Oracle engineers and the Java community has led to the creation and release of Java 9.</p>

    <p style="color:#333333; font-family:Verdana; font-size:16px">Java 9 not only brings improvements to the language
      and the library, but also extensively remodels its whole system. This course will take you through the features
      and concepts of the new module system as well as the significant&nbsp;language and library updates.</p>
